<b>Dionysus</b> - the patron god of the Greek stage

A clojure implemented Actor model.
<br/>
While reading up on the actor model presented
by Akka, I came accross this issue with Scala[1]
its days may be numbered, so looking to a
Clojure implementation, there is Pulsar. This
then will be more of a scratchpad of work on
the actor model for my own interest. Work may
be duplicated, it may be cobbled, it may be
wrong, it may, or may not, be released, but the 
intent is to work up a framework that can facilitate 
an actor model implementation
